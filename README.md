Movie recommendation engine built in python.

Recommendations are given using a hybrid of keyword-based and content-based recommendation strategies.

Keywords are taken from the movie's title, genre, director, and actor.

The descriptions of each movie is filtered and uncessary stopwords are removed to create addition keywords.
